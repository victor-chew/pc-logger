# PC Logger

PC Logger is an [Autoit](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) script that 
logs information about the active window on a Windows machine periodically (default: every minute) to a given Google Form.

I was looking for a solution to monitor my kids' computers during online learning. They were constantly tempted to play games during online classes, and sometimes they were so immersed they missed classes or did not complete assignments. 

I tried some commercial solutions and also tried locking down on the router, but they were mostly unsatisfactory. There were just too many forms of distractions. Furthermore, some resources (eg. YouTube) can be used by the school for online research, but could also be a form of distraction. 

This method is both simple to implement and very effective. By keeping a log of information about the active window on their computers, I was able to have a pretty good picture of what they are doing with their computers, and have a chat with them when things go out of hand.

I think this solution could potentially be used for other purposes, including employee tracking and so on.
